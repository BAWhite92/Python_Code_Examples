# Python_Code_Examples
A series of small code examples of my current Python knowledge ranging from basic String and Dictionary manipulation to Database access and much more.

Within the "Databases with Python" folder there are the "Geolocation" and "Tracks" folders which are projects created to practice database
manipulation with Python.
